This is a fork of Santa's Nixie Tubes [original mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SantasNixieTubeDisplay), to add more UPS options.

- Allows skipping frames to improve UPS.
- It doesn't use tanks as sprites for the numbers, so it will even show up nice on the mini map.
- It doesn't use characters for colors, so no ups drops from lots of characters on the map
- Only positive numbers (negative numbers will show up as positive numbers at this time)
- No colors (Nixies are originaly orange from the heated metal, maybe i'll look into adding this feature)

# Changelog
